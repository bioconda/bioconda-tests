The tree will be broken into initial subtrees before further processing
Enter initial support threshold for these initial subtrees
To use the default setting of 0.9 enter y or enter a new value:
Please enter main support threshold for clusters
To use the default setting of 0.9 enter y or enter a new value:
Please enter genetic distance threshold for clusters in %
To use the default setting of 4.5% enter y or enter a new value (e.g. 5.0):
To output all cluster names for clusters of size >= X enter X
To use default = 10 enter y or enter a new value or enter 0 to output nothing:
Please enter scoring type for genetic distance
abs      	= count absolute character differences
gap      	= disregard sites with -, ~, or n
valid    	= only count differences for sites with nucleotides: a, c, t, g in both sequences
ambiguity	= disregard sites with -, ~, or n and do not count ambiguities as differences (e.g. a vs r is not a difference)
To use default = gap enter y or enter new value from list above
