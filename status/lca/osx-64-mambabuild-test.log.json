LCA help
Usage: ./LCA [[ optional_args ]] -i [blast m8 output] -r [taxonomy database] -o [output file]
Required arguments:
  -i mapping assignments of sequences to ref database in blast .m8 tab delimited format
  -r taxonomy file with entries corresponding to sequences in ref database, that was mapped against
  -o output file containing the sequence name and the assigned taxonomy against the ref database
Optional arguments:
  -matHigh       calculate abundance of reads at different taxonomic levels. An extra file (derriving from -o) per tax level is written
  -showHitRead   if a hit can be uniquely assigned to a single entry in the ref database, this is reported in the -o file.
  -no_bl_filter  use only, if custom scripts were used to pre-filter filter -i file and in-built filter should be deactivated
  -readInput     [miTag / OTU] changes the tags attached to single reads
  -LCAfrac       [0-1] the fraction of matching taxonomies required to accept this taxonomy on the different levels. Default="0.8"
  -id            comma seperated list of min %identity, to accept a database hit as applicable to this taxonomic level, starting from Species and going to Kingdom. Default="97,95,93,91,88,78,0"
  -cover         [0-1] fraction of query coverage required to accept a hit. Default=0.5
