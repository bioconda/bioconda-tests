*** Canary::Stability COMPATIBILITY AND SUPPORT CHECK
*** =================================================
***
*** Hi!
***
*** I do my best to provide predictable and reliable software.
***
*** However, in recent releases, P5P (who maintain perl) have been
*** introducing regressions that are sometimes subtle and at other times
*** catastrophic, often for personal preferences with little or no concern
*** for existing code, most notably CPAN.
***
*** For this reason, it has become very hard for me to maintain the level
*** of reliability and support I have committed myself to in the past, at
*** least with some perl versions: I simply can't keep up working around new
*** bugs or gratituous incompatibilities, and in turn you might suffer from
*** unanticipated problems.
***
*** Therefore I have introduced a support and compatibility check, the results
*** of which follow below, together with a FAQ and some recommendations.
***
*** This check is just to let you know that there might be a risk, so you can
*** make judgement calls on how to proceed - it will not keep the module from
*** installing or working.
***
*** The stability canary says: (nothing, it was driven away by harsh weather)
***
*** It seems you are running perl version 5.026002, likely the "official" or
*** "standard" version. While there is nothing wrong with doing that,
*** standard perl versions 5.022 and up are not supported by .
*** While this might be fatal, it might also be all right - if you run into
*** problems, you might want to downgrade your perl or switch to the
*** stability branch.
***
*** If everything works fine, you can ignore this message.
***
***
*** Stability canary mini-FAQ:
***
*** Do I need to do anything?
***    With luck, no. While some distributions are known to fail
***    already, most should probably work. This message is here
***    to alert you that your perl is not supported by ,
***    and if things go wrong, you either need to downgrade, or
***    sidegrade to the stability variant of your perl version,
***    or simply live with the consequences.
***
*** What is this canary thing?
***    It's purpose is to check support status of  with
***    respect to your perl version.
***
*** What is this "stability branch"?
***    It's a branch or fork of the official perl, by schmorp, to
***    improve stability and compatibility with existing modules.
***
*** How can I skip this prompt on automated installs?
***    Set PERL_CANARY_STABILITY_NOPROMPT=1 in your environment.
***    More info is in the Canary::Stability manpage.
