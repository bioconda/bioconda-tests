For Linux 64, Open MPI is built with CUDA awareness but this support is disabled by default.
To enable it, please set the environment variable OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support=true before
launching your MPI processes. Equivalently, you can set the MCA parameter in the command line:
mpiexec --mca opal_cuda_support 1 ...
 
In addition, the UCX support is also built but disabled by default.
To enable it, first install UCX (conda install -c conda-forge ucx). Then, set the environment
variables OMPI_MCA_pml="ucx" OMPI_MCA_osc="ucx" before launching your MPI processes.
Equivalently, you can set the MCA parameters in the command line:
mpiexec --mca pml ucx --mca osc ucx ...
Note that you might also need to set UCX_MEMTYPE_CACHE=n for CUDA awareness via UCX.
Please consult UCX's documentation for detail.

usage: hyphy or HYPHYMPI [-h] [--help][-c] [-d] [-i] [-p] [BASEPATH=directory path] [CPU=integer] [LIBPATH=library path] [USEPATH=library path] [<standard analysis name> or <path to hyphy batch file>] [--keyword value ...] [positional arguments ...]

Execute a HyPhy analysis, either interactively, or in batch mode
optional flags:
  -h --help                show this help message and exit
  -c                       calculator mode; causes HyPhy to drop into an expression evaluation until 'exit' is typed
  -d                       debug mode; causes HyPhy to drop into an expression evaluation mode upon script error
  -i                       interactive mode; causes HyPhy to always prompt the user for analysis options, even when defaults are available
  -m                       write diagnostic messages to messages.log
optional global arguments:
  BASEPATH=directory path  defines the base directory for all path operations (default is pwd)
  CPU=integer              if compiled with OpenMP multithreading support, requests this many threads; HyPhy could use fewer than this
                           but never more; default is the number of CPU cores (as computed by OpenMP) on the system
  LIBPATH=directory path   defines the directory where HyPhy library files are located (default installed location is /usr/local/lib/hyphy
                           or as configured during CMake installation
  USEPATH=directory path   specifies the optional working and relative path directory (default is BASEPATH)

  ENV=expression           set HBL environment variables via explicit statements
                           for example ENV='DEBUG_MESSAGES=1;WRITE_LOGS=1'
  batch file to run        if specified, execute this file, otherwise drop into an interactive mode
  analysis arguments       if batch file is present, all remaining positional arguments are interpreted as inputs to analysis prompts

optional keyword arguments (can appear anywhere); will be consumed by the requested analysis
  --keyword value          will be passed to the analysis (which uses KeywordArgument directives)
                           multiple values for the same keywords are treated as an array of values for multiple selectors

usage examples:

Select a standard analysis from the list : 
	hyphy -i 
Run a standard analysis with default options and one required user argument; 
	hyphy busted --alignment path/to/file
Run a standard analysis with additional keyword arguments 
	hyphy busted --alignment path/to/file --srv No
See which arguments are understood by a standard analysis 
	hyphy busted --help
Run a custom analysis and pass it some arguments 
	hyphy path/to/hyphy.script argument1 'argument 2'
