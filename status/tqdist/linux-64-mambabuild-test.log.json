Usage: triplet_dist [-v] <filename1> <filename2>

Where <filename1> and <filename2> point to two files each containing one
tree in Newick format. In both trees all leaves should be labeled and the
two trees should have the same set of leaf labels.
The triplet distance between the two trees will be printed to stdout.
If the -v option is used, the following numbers will be reported (in this
order):
	 - The number of leaves in the trees (should be the same for both).
	 - The number of triplets in the two trees (n choose 3).
	 - The triplet distance between the two trees.
	 - The normalized triplet distance between the two trees.
	 - The number of resolved triplets that agree in the two trees.
	 - The normalized number of resolved triplets that agree in the two trees.
	 - The number triplets that are unresolved in both trees.
	 - The normalized number triplets that are unresolved in both trees.

Usage: quartet_dist [-v] <filename1> <filename2>

Where: <filename1> and <filename2> point to two files each containing
one tree in Newick format. In both trees all leaves should be labeled
and the two trees should have the same set of leaf labels.
The quartet distance between the two trees will be printed to stdout.
If the -v option is used, the following numbers will be reported (in this
order):
	 - The number of leaves in the trees (should be the same for both).
	 - The number of quartets in the two trees (n choose 3).
	 - The quartet distance between the two trees.
	 - The normalized quartet distance between the two trees.
	 - The number of resolved quartets that agree in the two trees.
	 - The normalized number of resolved quartets that agree in the two trees.
	 - The number of quartets that are unresolved in both trees.
	 - The normalized number of quartets that are unresolved in both trees.
