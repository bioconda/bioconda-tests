Generate the enriched probscore summary graph and filter the summary graph to get rid of ineligible windows 
Determine the score threshold from random background
The score threshold is:  7.055
Make and write islands
	chrY does not have any islands meeting the required significance
	chr21 does not have any islands meeting the required significance
Total number of islands:  143

Normalize summary graph with filtered reads for test by total island filtered reads per million...
python $PREFIX/share/sicer-1.1-3/SICER/src/normalize.py -i ./test-W200-G400-E100-islandfiltered.graph -a 3 -t 1000000 -o ./test-W200-G400-E100-islandfiltered-normalized.graph


Convert the summary graph made with the filtered reads into wig vstep format and normalize by total island-filtered read count per million...
sh $PREFIX/share/sicer-1.1-3/SICER/src/variableStep.sh ./test-W200-G400-E100-islandfiltered-normalized.graph ./test-W200-G400-E100-islandfiltered-normalized.wig test 200
