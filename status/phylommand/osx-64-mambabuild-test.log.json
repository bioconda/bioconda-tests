Contree 1.0 is a command line program for comparing trees. It can compare
trees in one file/input against each other or compare the trees in one file/
input to the trees in another file/input.
(c) Martin Ryberg 2016.

Usage:
contree [arguments] file.trees

Arguments:
--add_to_support / -a           add one to the value of the internal node for
                                each tree that that split is present in.
--calculate_support / -s        same as --add_to_support but divide the number
                                by number of trees compared against.
--compare / -c [value]          output conflicting splits where at least one
                                branch support the conflict with more than given
                                support, e.g. -c 0.7.
--database / -d [file]          give a second file of trees to compare against
                                instead of comparing within the ordinary input.
                                If - is given input will be taken from standard
                                in instead of file, e.g. -d -. In that case the
                                input compared to must  be given in a file (by
                                -f or as last argument).
--decisiveness / -D [genes]     calculates proportion of random trees for which
                                given gene sampling is decisive and the mean
                                proportion of branches that are distinguished.
                                (Sanderson et al. 2010, BMC Evol. Biol. 19:
                                155). The genes for each taxon are given as a
                                comma (,) separated string, the genes for
                                different taxon are separated by a bar (|). E.g
                                -D 'ITS,RPB2|ITS|ITS,RPB2|RPB2|RPB2|ITS', or in
                                a file (given by -f or as last argument) with a
                                comma separated string with the genes for each
                                taxa on a separate row. No taxon names, trees,
                                or sequences are needed.
--iterations / -i [number]      give numbers of iterations to do when
                                calculating decisiveness, e.g. -i 1000.
--file / -f [file]              give file name for trees, or decisiveness, e.g.
                                -f file.tree.
--format [newick/nexus]         give format of input, e.g. --format nexus. If no
                                format is given and the input is a file contree
                                will try to guess the format, if it is through
                                standard in it will assume newick format. A
                                separate file format can be given for the
                                database file after a ',', e.g. --format
                                newick,nexus. If only one format is given, it
                                will be used for both tree files/inputs.
--help / -h                     print this help.
--html                          give output as tree in html (svg) format with
                                conflicting tips coloured green and red when
                                doing --compare.
--non_shared_tips / -t          print tip names not present in the other tree.
--output [newick/nexus]         give tree format for output, nexus (nex or x for
                                short) or newick (new or w for short), e.g
                                --output x. (default w).
--robinson_foulds / -r          compute Robinson-Foulds metric between trees.
--rooted / -R                   treat trees as rooted for --add_to_support and
                                --calculate_support.
--verbose / -v                  get additional output.

Pairalign 1.0 will perform pairwise alignment of DNA sequences given in fasta
format through standard in.
(c) Martin Ryberg 2016.

Usage:
pairalign [arguments] < inputfile.fasta
pairalign [arguments] inputfile.fasta

Arguments:
--aligned / -A                  input file is already aligned.
--alignments / -a               output aligned sequences pairwise.
--difference / -i               output difference between the Jukes-Cantor (JC)
                                distance and proportion different sites.
--distances / -d                output proportion different sites, JC distance,
                                and diference between the two.
--format [fasta/pairfst]        set the format of the input to fasta or fasta
                                with sequences pairwise (as output given the -a
                                -n option). If sequences are aligned give the -A
                                switch.
--group / -g                    this option will cluster sequences that are
                                similar and/or find the most inclusive taxa in a
                                hierarchy that are alignable according to MAD
                                (Smith et al. 2009, BMC evol. Biol. 9:37). It
                                need the taxonomy given after a (the first) | in
                                the sequence name or in a separate file. Each
                                taxa in the hierarchy should be separated by a
                                semicolon, with the highest rank first and then
                                increasingly nested levels until the lowest
                                known level for the sequence. The groups that
                                can be aligned are put in a file with the ending
                                .alignment_groups and printed to the screen
                                preceded by #. Clusters are printed to the
                                screen after a heading, preceded by ###. To get
                                alignable groups give 'alignment_groups' as
                                extra argument, to cluster give 'cluster', and
                                to do both give 'both'. Cut off value for
                                pairwise similarity can be given after colon (:)
                                by cut-off= followed value, e.g. -g both:
                                cut-off=0.97. A file with taxonomy can be given
                                with taxonomy=. The taxonomy file should have
                                the taxonomy (as above) first on each row
                                followed by a |, and the sequence name with that
                                taxonomy as a comma (,) and/or space ( )
                                separated string. The same taxon can be repeated
                                several times.
--help / -h                     print this help.
--jc_distance / -j              output Jukes-Cantor (JC) distance.
--matrix / -m                   output in the form of a space separated
                                left-upper triangular matrix.
--names / -n                    output sequence names (if outputting alignments
                                then in fasta format).
--proportion_difference / -p    output proportion sites that are different.
--similarity / -s               output similarity between sequences (1-proportion
                                different).
--threads / -T [number]         set the number of threads additional to the
                                controlling thread, e.g. -T 4. The order of
                                output between pairs are not guaranteed for more
                                than one thread (default 1).
--verbose / -v                  get additional output.
Treebender 1.0 is a command line program for manipulating trees. The program
take a tree in newick or nexus format as indata through standard in or from a
file and process it according to given options.
(c) Martin Ryberg 2016.

Usage:
treebender [arguments] < file.tree
treebender [arguments] file.tree

For the second alternative you need to be careful so treebender does not
interpret the filename as an extra argument to a switch. If this happen
treebender will expect input from standard in and it will appear as nothing is
happening. This can be avoided by giving the filename after the switch --file/
-f. When taxa should be given as extra arguments they can be given in a text
following the format for the argument. Newline and carriage returns will be
ignored. The file name should be given behind the word file and colon, e.g.
-d file:file_name.txt.

Arguments:
--branch_lengths / -a [r/n]       print branch lengths, the separator can be
                                  given as first argument after the switch, e.g.
                                   -a '\n' (default is ','). If the switch r is
                                  given as second argument after a colon (:),
                                  e.g. -a '\n:r', the value of the root branch
                                  will be printed as well, if n (default) is
                                  given it will not.  A separator between output
                                  from different trees can be given after
                                  another colon.
--change_names / -c [taxa]        change the name of tips. Tip names to be

                                  fewer than a certain number of tips
                                  (max_tree_size/s). The number should be given
