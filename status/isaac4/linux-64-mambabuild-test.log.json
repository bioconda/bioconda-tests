Command line options:

                                                  not set, each read is

                                                  anomalous pair needs to have

                                                  instead of a rescued pair.
  --bam-exclude-tags arg (=ZX,ZY)                 Comma-separated list of

  --bam-header-tag arg                            Additional bam entries that 
                                                  are copied into the header of
                                                  each produced bam file. Use 
                                                  '\t' to represent tab 
                                                  separators.
  --bam-pessimistic-mapq arg (=0)                 When set, the MAPQ is

                                                  is produced for each output
