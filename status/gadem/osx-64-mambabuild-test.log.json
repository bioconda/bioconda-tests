Usage: gadem -fseq seqFile [optional arguments]

Optional arguments that need attention:

  -posWt    0,1, or 2  Weight profile for positions on the sequence (see documentation).
                       0 - no weight (uniform spatial prior), 1 or 2 - small or zero weights for
                       the ends and large weights for the center (e.g. the center 50 bp) (1 -
                       gaussian prior, 2 - triangular prior). If you expect strong central
                       enrichment for motifs (as in ChIP-seq) and your sequences are long
                       (e.g. >100 bp), choose type 1 (default).

  -widthWt  integer    For -posWt 1 or 2, width of central sequence region with large EM weights
                       for PWM optimization (default: 50). This argument is ignored when -posWt
                       is 0 (uniform prior).

  -ev       decimal    ln(E-value) cutoff for selecting MOTIFS (default: 0.0).
                       If a seeded analysis fails to identify the expected motif, run GADEM with
                       -verbose 1 to show motif ln(E-value)s on screen, then re-run with a larger
                       ln(E-value) cutoff. This can help in identifying short and/or low abundance
                       motifs, for which the default log(E-value) threshold may be too low. A larger
                       value (e.g., 10000) can return groups of closely related motifs (possible 
                       variants) whereas a smaller value (<0) returns fewer (but conserved) motifs.

                       To identify potential motif variants, set -ev large, e.g., 10000 and -minN small
                       e.g., numSeq/10. This allows gadem to identify motif variants that are present
                       in at least 10 percent of the sequences. A large log(E-value) cutoff enures
                       such motifs are found.

                       The subroutine for E-value calculation is adapted from the MEME package.

  -pv       decimal    P-value cutoff for declaring BINDING SITES (default: 0.00025).
                       Depending on data size and the motif, you might want to assess more than one
                       value. For ChIP-seq data (e.g., 10 thousand +/-200-bp max-center peak 'cores'),
                       p=0.00025 often seems appropriate. 

                       Given a subsequence s of length w, GADEM computes the log likelihood (llr)
                       score, log{p(s|M)/p(s|B)}, where M is the EM-derived motif model, B is the
                       0-th order Markov background model and w is the motif length. GADEM uses the
                       [a,c,g,t] frequencies from the foreground data as the parameters for the
                       0th Makrov background model. The subsequence is declared a binding site if 
                       its llr score is at or above the llr score corresponding to the p-value cutoff.
                       This requires knowing the distribution of the llr score (under the null), and
                       GADEM first integerizes the log(Mij/Bj) llr score matrix, where i=1,...,w and
                       j=1,2,3,4, by multiplying it with a large constant (200) followed by rounding
                       the real numbers to their closest integers. The null distribution of the
                       integerized llr scores is then determined using the Staden probability
                       generating function method (Comput. Appl. Biosci,5,89,1989). See Hertz,GZ &
                       Stormo GD (Bioinformatics 1999, 15:563-577) for a review.

  -minN     integer    Minimal number of sites required for a motif to be reported (default: numSeq/20).

  -fpwm0    string     File name for the seed PWM, when a 'seeded' approach is used, in which a PWM 
                       (format below) is used as the starting PWM for the EM algorithm. This is an 
                       effective way of testing for an 'expected' motif, because it is focused, robust 
                       to noise, and much faster than 'unseeded' de novo discovery. Also, when a seed 
                       PWM is specified, the run results are deterministic, so only a single run is 
                       needed (repeat runs with the same settings will give identical results). In 
                       contrast, unseeded runs are stochastic, and we recommend comparing results 
                       from several repeat runs.

                       Format: number of rows & columns followed by integer counts OR decimal freq.
                       Example: PWM (CREB, JASPAR MA0018) in two acceptable representations:

                       4     12
                       0     3     0     2     5     0     0    16     0     0     1     5
                       7     5     3     3     1     0     0     0    16     0     5     6
                       5     4     6    11     7     0    15     0     0    16     0     3
                       4     4     7     0     3    16     1     0     0     0    10     2

  -bfile    string     File name for background model. The current version only supports 0-th Markov
                       background model
                       Format:
                       #monomer frequencies (this line is optional)
                       a	0.2834
                       c	0.2215
                       g	0.2333
                       t	0.2618

Other optional arguments:

  -gen      integer    Number of genetic algorithm (GA) generations (default: 5).
  -pop      integer    GA population size (default: 100).
                       Both default settings should work well for most datasets (ChIP-chip and
                       ChIP-seq). The above two arguments are ignored in a seeded analysis,
                       because spaced dyads and GA are no longer needed (-gen is set to 1 and
                       -pop is set to 10 internally, corresponding to the 10 maxp choices).

  -fullScan 0 or 1     GADEM keeps two copies of the input sequences internally: one (D) for
                       discovering PWMs and one (S) for scanning for binding sites using the PWMs.
                       Once a motif is identified, its instances in set D are always masked by Ns.
                       However, masking motif instances in set S is optional, and scanning unmasked
                       sequences allows sites of discovered motifs to overlap.

                       0 (default) - scan masked sequences in S (disallow motif site overlap).
                       1 - scan unmasked sequences in S (allow motif sites to overlap) (was default
                       in v1.3).

  -maskR    0 or 1     Mask repetitive, low-complexity sequences as below(default: 0-no masking,1-masking):
                       a) 'aaaaaaaa', 'tttttttt', 'cacacaca', 'tgtgtgtg', or 'tatatatat', each of which
                          is at least 8 nucleotides long.
                       b) 'ggaggaggagga','gaggaggaggag','agaagaagaaga','ctcctcctcctc','tcctcctcctcc',
                          'tcttcttcttct','tagtagtagtag','aataataataat','attattattatt','ataataataata'
                           each of which is at least 12 nucleotides long.
                       c) 'cagcagcagcagcag' that is at least 15 nucleotides long.
                       no other subsequences are masked. The sequences with masked sites are outputed.

  -em       integer    Number of EM steps (default: 40). One might want to set it to a larger value
                       (e.g. 80) in a seeded run, because such runs are fast.

                       If you wish to scan the sequences with a PWM, set -em to 0.

  -fEM      decimal    Fraction of sequences used in EM to obtain PWMs in an unseeded analysis
                       (default: 0.5). For unseeded motif discovery in a large dataset (e.g. >10
                       million nt), one might want to set -fEM to a smaller value (e.g., 0.3 or 0.4)
                       to reduce run time.

                       Note that when only partial input data are used in EM and verbose is set to 1, the
                       number of binding sites printed on screen is the number of sites found only
                       in the fraction of sequences that are used in EM optimization[GR1].

                       This argument is ignored in a seeded analysis, which uses all sequences in EM.

  -extTrim  1 or 0     Base extension and trimming (1 -yes, 0 -no) (default: 1).
  -nmotifs  integer    Maximal number of motifs sought (default: 25).

  -maxw3    integer    Number of top-ranked trimers for spaced dyads (default: 20).
  -maxw4    integer    Number of top-ranked tetramers for spaced dyads (default: 40).
  -maxw5    integer    Number of top-ranked pentamers for spaced dyads (default: 60).

  -mingap   integer    Minimal number of unspecified nucleotides in spaced dyads (default: 0).
  -maxgap   integer    Maximal number of unspecified nucleotides in spaced dyads (default: 10).
                       -mingap and -maxgap control the lengths of spaced dyads, and, with -extrim,
                       control motif lengths. Longer motifs can be discovered by setting -maxgap to
                       larger values (e.g. 50).
                       To identify short motifs (6-10 bps), set both -maxgap and -maxw5 to 0

  -useScore 0 or 1     Use top-scoring sequences for deriving PWMs. Sequence (quality) scores should
                       be stored in input sequence FA headers (see documentation).
                       0 - no (default, randomly select sequences), 1 - yes.

  -fpwm     string     Name of output PWM file in STAMP format (http://www.benoslab.pitt.edu/stamp).
                       (default: observedPWMs.txt). This file can be loaded into STAMP to compare
                       each PWM with PWMs in databases for similarity.

  -fout     string     Name of main GADEM output file (see documentation for description) (default:
                       gadem.txt).

  -nbs      integer    Number of sets of randomly simulated sequences (default: 10) using the [a,c,g,t]
                       frequencies in the input sequences, with length matched between the two sets.
                       Those sequences are used as the random sequences for assessing motif enrichment
                       in the input data.


  -verbose  1 or 0     Print immediate results on screen [1-yes (default), 0-no]. These results
                       include the motif consensus sequence, number of sites (in the subset of sequences
                       subjected to EM optimization, see -fEM, above), and ln(E-value).
