                                        Downsampling factor (only used for 
                                        alignment method 3).
  --Align.bandExtend arg (=10)          Amount to extend the downsampled band 
                                        (only used for alignment method 3).

                                        from the same nanopore channel and 
                                        close in time are suppressed. The 
                                        "read" meta data fields from the FASTA 
                                        or FASTQ header are checked. If their 
                                        difference, in absolute value, is less 
                                        than the value of this option, the 
                                        alignment is suppressed. This can help 
                                        avoid assembly artifact. This check is 
                                        only done if the two reads have 
                                        identical meta data fields "runid", 
                                        "sampleid", and "ch". If any of these 
                                        meta data fields are missing, this 
                                        check is suppressed and this option has
                                        no effect.
