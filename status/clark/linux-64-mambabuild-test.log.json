CLARK -- ``CLAssifier based on Reduced K-mers'', UCR CS&E 2013-2019

./CLARK -k <kmerSize> -t <minFreqTarget> -o <minFreqObject> -T <fileTargets> -D <directoryDB/> -O <fileObjects> -R <fileResults> -m <mode> -n <numberofthreads> ...


Definitions of parameters (cf. README file, for details):

-k <kmerSize>,       	 k-mer length:	integer, >= 2 and <= 32 (for CLARK only). The default value is 31.
-t <minFreqTarget>,  	 minimum of k-mer frequency in targets (for CLARK only):	integer, >=0.
-o <minFreqtObject>, 	 minimum of k-mer frequency in objects  (for CLARK only):	integer, >=0.
-T <fileTargets>,    	 filename of the targets definition:	 text.
-D <directoryDB/>,   	 directory name for the database (to load/save database files):	 text.
-O <fileObjects>,    	 filename of objects (or list of objects):	 text.
-P <file1> <file2>,  	 filenames of paired-end reads:	 texts.
-R <fileResults>,    	 filename to store results (or corresponding list of results file):	 text.
-m <mode>,           	 mode of execution: 0 (full), 1 (default), 2 (express) and 3 (spectrum).
                     	 For CLARK-S, the full and default mode are the same.
-n <numberofthreads>,	 number of threads:	integer >= 1.
--long,              	 to indicate that the objects files contains very long/large sequences (e.g.,
                     	 long contigs from genome assembly, long sequencing reads from Nanopore or Pacbio, etc.)
                     	 and allocate more memory accordingly. This option is only for running the full mode or 
                     	 running CLARK-S, in the case of sequences up to 50 Mbp.
--tsk,               	 to request a detailed creation of the database (target specific k-mers files). This option is no more supported.
--ldm,               	 to request the loading of the database by memory mapped-file (in multithreaded mode, multiple parallel threads are requested).
--kso,               	 to request a preliminary k-spectrum analysis of each object (for mode 3 only).
--extended,          	 to request an extended output of the full mode (for CLARK only).
-g <iteration>,      	 gap or number of non-overlapping k-mers to pass for the database creation (for CLARK-l only). The default value is 4.
-s <factor>,         	 sampling factor value in the default mode (for CLARK/CLARK-S only). 

--help,              	 to print help/options.
--version,           	 to print the version info.
