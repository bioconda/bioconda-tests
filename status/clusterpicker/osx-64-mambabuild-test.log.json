Please enter scoring type for genetic distance
abs      	= count absolute character differences
gap      	= disregard sites with -, ~, or n
valid    	= only count differences for sites with nucleotides: a, c, t, g in both sequences
ambiguity	= disregard sites with -, ~, or n and do not count ambiguities as differences (e.g. a vs r is not a difference)
To use default = gap enter y or enter new value from list above
