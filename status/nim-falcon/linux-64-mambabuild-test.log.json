  utils                         
  bam-filter-ipa                Print subreads which have decent alignments in

  align-filter                  alias for bam-filter-ipa

  bam-filter-clipped            Filter alignments with significant clipping.
                                To skip an alignment, both max_clipping and
                                end_margin must be exceeded on at least 1 end.
  falcon-read2ctg-augment       Assigns the unphased reads to haplotigs or
                                primary contigs based on pbmm2 mapping.
  raptor-db-filter              Read/write raptor-db to/from stdin/stdout.
                                Exclude zmws in blacklist.
  raptor-db-calc-length-cutoff  Perform a linear pass on an overlap file,
                                and determine rough clipping coordinates to
                                'correct' reads. Write integer to stdout.

  circ-orient                   reorients circular sequences based on gc-skew
                                distribution and writes to output.
  circ-randomize                randomly rotates left rotates the sequence and
                                writes to the output file.
  phasr                         Phase PacBio CCS/HIFI reads.
  m4filt-merge-blacklist        
  m4filt-stage1                 
  m4filt-stage2                 
  m4filt-dump-blacklist         
  m4filt                        Run the multi-stage m4 overlap filter (for HiFi
                                Asm). Take only one m4 file, inFn. If in+'.idx'
                                exists, that is the index. In stage one, reads
                                that trigger a filter are marked including
                                containment, gaps in coverage along the A-read,
                                and repeat reads. In stage two the filters are
                                applied and the N-best overlaps are kept for the
                                5prime and 3prime of each read.
  m4filt-falconRunner           Runs the multi-stage m4 overlap filter for
                                falcon. In stage one, reads that trigger a
                                filter are marked including containment, gaps in
                                coverage along the A-read, and repeat reads. In
                                stage two the filters are applied and the N-best
                                overlaps are kept for the 5prime and 3prime of
                                each read.
  m4filt-ipaRunner              Runs the multi-stage m4 overlap filter for IPA.
                                In stage one, reads that trigger a filter are
                                marked including containment, gaps in coverage
                                along the A-read, and repeat reads. In stage two
                                the filters are applied and the N-best overlaps
                                are kept for the 5prime and 3prime of each read.
  m4filt-contained              Parse .m4 file. Write only the overlaps which
                                pass the filters. (no overlaps involving
                                contained reads; no overlaps involving short
                                reads; no overlaps with low identity)
  m4filt-idx                    Given foo.m4, create index file foo.m4.idx
                                (Or just use it if it exists.) Format is "0000
                                count start len", where count is the number of
                                overlaps in the pile. (First field is dummy,
                                instead of Aread name, for efficiency.) Return
                                the sum of all pileups, which should exactly
                                match filesize.
  ovl-cov-stats                 
  pbcromwell-rm-las             Remove all .las files except final stage of
                                merge. (Unzip is still possible.) Filepaths
                                come from the provided command as a subprocess,
                                or from stdin if command=="-", (Someday, we
                                will add a flag to delete the final stage too,
                                optionally.)
  pbreports-circ                Given FASTA of all ctgs and text-list of
                                circular ctgs, print a report (pbreports
                                format).
  pbreports-ctg-table           
  stats-assembly                
  stats-preassembly             
  stats-gff                     
  rr-hctg-track1                
  rr-hctg-track2                Stage 2 of rr_hctg_track
  bam2clippedFasta              Very similar to `samtools fasta`, but the reads
                                are subSequenced.  Output is printed to STDOUT
  bam2paf                       https://bioconvert.readthedocs.io/en/master/formats.html#paf-pairwise-mapping-format
  paf-filter                    Drop the lines of PAF that involve contigs
                                not in FASTA index. Write the rest to
                                out_paf_fn. ("-" means stdin/stdout for PAF.)
                                https://bioconvert.readthedocs.io/en/master/formats.html#paf-pairwise-mapping-format
  ipa2-construct-config         Takes an advanced options string, and
                                reformats it into JSON format. Input/output
                                is on stdin/stdout. Options which aren't set
                                explicitly in the input will be set to default
                                (configurable via args).
  ipa-shard-ovl-asym            (Used to shard the asymmetric overlap jobs.)
  ipa-shard-mapping             Generate comparisons for nq-by-nt matrix. (Used
                                to shard the purge_dups overlap jobs, contigs
                                vs. reads.)
  ipa-polish-split              The trailing list of fasta.fai filenames are
                                FASTA index files. They will be used to split
                                the shards somewhat evenly. (Used to shard the
                                polishing jobs.)
  ipa-shard-blocks-m4           Given several {block_prefix}.(block_id).m4
                                files, create up to {max_nshards} files that
                                each contain a list of block_ids (one per line).
                                For now, they are balanced by the number of
                                reads in each .m4 file. (Later, the contents of
                                each shard will be processed linearly, one block
                                at a time, on a given compute node.) (Used to
                                shard the phasing jobs.)
  ipa2-polish-prepare           DEPRECATED

falconc {-h|--help} or with no args at all prints this message.
falconc --help-syntax gives general cligen syntax help.
