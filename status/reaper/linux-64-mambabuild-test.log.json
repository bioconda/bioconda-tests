Usage: <bin> -i <input_file> [-f <f0_output> -p <pitchmarks_output> \
-c <correlations_output> -t -s -e <float> -x <float> -m <float> \
-u <float> -w <float> -a -d <debug_output_basename>] 

 Help:
-t enables a Hilbert transform that may reduce phase distortion
-s suppress applying high pass filter at 80Hz (rumble-removal highpass filter)
-e specifies the output frame interval for F0
-x maximum f0 to look for
-m minimum f0 to look for
-u regular inter-mark interval to use in UV pitchmark regions
-w set the cost for unvoiced segments
   (def. 0.9, the higher the value the more f0 estimates in noise)
-a saves F0 and PM output in ascii mode
-d write diagnostic output to this file pattern

Outputs:
The output files specified with -f and -p are Edinburgh Speech Tool
(EST) style files.  These are output as binary by default, ASCII with
the -a option.  The F0 values in the f0_output file are resampled with
the frame interval specified by option -e (default .005 s).
The unvoiced regions of the pitchmark file are filled with marks spaced
by the interval specified with -u (default .01 s).

It is strongly recommended that the default high-pass filter be
applied to all input signals to remove DC and low-frequency
components.  For signals that have been recorded using close-talking
microphones, or those that have been subjected to various other
non-linear phase distortions in the studio, or in post-production, it
is often helpful to apply a Hilbert transform (-t option).  The .resid
file output when -d is specified can be examined to determine if the
voice pulses look anything like the classical glottal-flow derivative,
and the Hilbert transform enabled, or not.

In the discussion below, the following notation is used:
Fs: sample rate
Fs0: sample rate of input file
nd: n-dimensional vector signal
ts: time-stamped vector signal; 1st ele. is the time of the sample in sec.
float, int16, etc.: atomic type of the data in the file

If -d <name>is specified, the following raw binary output files are produced,
with the base path as specified in <name>, and the indicated extensions:
.bestcorr 2d float ts the highest NCC value found at each residual peak
.bprms 1d float Fs=500 RMS of 100-1000 Hz bandpassed input signal
.f0ap 3d float ts F0 and NCC value found for each period
.resid 1d float Fs=Fs0 LPC residual of conditioned input signal
.nresid 1d float Fs=Fs0 LPC residual with local gain normalization
.offsetp 1d float Fs=500 pseudo-probability that voicing is terminating
.onsetp 1d float Fs=500 pseudo-probability that voicing is starting
.pvoiced 1d float Fs=500 pseudo-probability that voicing is occurring
.pcm 1d float Fs=Fs0 conditioned input signal
.pmlab ASCII 'xlabel' format file of epoch marks
.pvals 1d float Fs=Fs0 graded residual peak candidates
