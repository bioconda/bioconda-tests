short_read_connector.sh - Compare reads from two read sets (distinct or not)
Version 1.0.0
Usage: sh short_read_connector.sh -b read_file -q read_file_of_files [OPTIONS]
MANDATORY:
 -b read_files for bank
   Example: -b data/c1.fasta.gz
 -q read_file_of_files for query
   Example: -q data/fof.txt (with fof being a file of file descriptor)
OPTIONS:
   -c use short_read_connector_counter (SRC_counter)
 OPTIONS USING SRC_counter (-c) OR SRC_linker
   -w <int> window_size. See option -s. If the windows size is zero (default value), then the full read is considered. Default=0
   -p <string> prefix. All out files will start with this prefix. Default="short_read_connector_res"
   -g with this option, if a file of solid kmer exists with same prefix name and same k value, then it is re-used and not re-computed.
   -k <int> value. Set the length of used kmers. Must fit the compiled value. Default=31
   -f <int> value. Fingerprint size. Size of the key associated to each indexed value, limiting false positives. Default=12
   -G <int> value. gamma value. MPHF expert users parameter - Default=2
   -a <int> kmer_abundance_min (kmer from bank seen less than this value both in the bank are not indexed). Default=2
   -l Keep low complexity regions (default false)
   -t <int> number of thread used. Default=0 (all)
 OPTIONS USING SRC_counter (-c)
   -s <int> kmer_threshold: Minimal percentage of shared kmer span for considering a query read as similar to a data set.  
            The kmer span is the number of bases from the read query covered by a kmer shared with the bank.
            If a read of length 80 has a kmer-span of 60, then the percentage of shared kmer span is 75%. If a least a windows (of size "windows_size") contains at least kmer_threshold percent of positions covered by shared kmers, the read is output.
 OPTIONS USING SRC_linker (without -c)
   -s <int> kmer_threshold: Minimal percentage of shared kmer span for considering 2 reads as similar.  
            The kmer span is the number of bases from the read query covered by a kmer shared with the target read.
            If a read of length 80 has a kmer-span of 60 with another read (of unkonwn size) from the bank, then the percentage of shared kmer span is 75%. If a least a windows (of size "windows_size") contains at least kmer_threshold percent of position covered by shared kmers, the read couple is output.
                 TRICK: with kmer_threshold<=0 a single kmer is sufficient in the linker mode to link two reads. 
   -A index kmers present at least 'kmer_abundance_min' times in the bank AND in the queries.
   -r (incompatible with SRC_counter), do not output precision about pair of similar reads. Only ids of reads from queries similar to at least one read from bank are output.
