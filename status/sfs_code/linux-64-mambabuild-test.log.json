PROGRAM:  	Selection on Finite Sites under COmplex DemographicEffects
		(SFS_CODE)
DEVELOPER: 	Ryan D. Hernandez
COPYRIGHT (C):	2007
DESCRIPTION:
	SFS_CODE simulates population genetic data under a wide range of
	demographic and selective models.

USAGE: ./sfs_code <NPOP> <ITER> [--option <argument(s)>]...
	where <NPOP> is the total number of populations to be simulated
	and <ITER> is the number of iterations you would like to run.

OPTIONS:
	(Note: arguments in '<..>' are required, in '[..]' are optional.
	Including the optional argument '[P <pop>]' will set the
	parameters just for population <pop>.  Both short name [single -,
	single letter] and long name [double --, full name] are provided,
	but you only need to enter one of them. * indicates that the option can 
	be used as a timed event (-T).)

	--mutation <time> [P <population>] [L <locus>] [S <site>] [G <gamma>]
		Add mutation at specified time in a particular [P]opulation, [L]ocus, 
		[S]ite, or selection effect [G]amma.

	--printGen
		print the generation throughout the simulation.  only useful for long
		simulations when the generations take a long time to run and you want
		status updates.

	--printLocus <locus>
		The default is to print output for all loci.  Use this option to print the output of just a single locus (or repeat to print multiple loci).

	--trackAncestry [a] <file>
		print the ancestry of each position simulated

	--trackTrajectory [T <time>] [P <pop>] [L <locus>] [S <site>] [R <min_freq> <max_freq> [S] [A [G <gens>]] [M <max_reps>]] [F [a] <file>]
		track the frequency each generation.  [R <min_freq> <max_freq> [S]] sets 
		the desired freq range at time of sampling ([S]topping first time in
		range).  [A] causes simulation to restart immediately after loss, or at (or
		some [G]enerations after) time of fixation if max_freq=1.

-A  --noSeq
		don't print ancestral sequence

-a	--annotate    [F <filename>] [<a1> [<a2>...<aR>] [R]]
		indicate whether each locus is coding/non-coding

-B	--BURN  <burn>
		set initial burn-in length, generations/P/N

-b	--BURN2  <burn>
		set burn-in length of subsequent iterations > 1

-C*	--PSI  [P <pop>] <psi>
		set the CpG mutation bias

-c*	--constraint  [P <pop>] [L <locus>] <f0>
		set the non-lethal mutation rate

-TD  <t> <i> <j> <allele_freq> <N> [locus]
		only used with -T to create a domesticated population at time <t>
from pop <i> to pop <j> with given <allele_freq> and resulting pop
size <N> at an optional [locus].

-Td  <t> [P <pop>] <v>
		only used with -T to set the demographic effects

-TE  <t> [pop]
		only used with -T to end the simulation for a population at time t

-e	--errfile  [a] <file> 
		print error to specific file

-F	--popFreq  [a] <file>
		create file with population & sample frequencies for each event
		
-f	--propFemale [P <pop>] <pf>

		set the generation effect for a population
		
-Tg  [P <pop>] <alpha>
		only used with -T to set the exponential population growth rate

-H*	--geneConversion  [P <pop>] [B <BGC>] <f> <lambda> 
		set parameters for gene conversion

-h	--help 
		help menu

-I	--INF_SITES 
		simulate infinite-sites model.  This only pertains to segregating
		variants.  For long simulations, sites that previously received a
		fixation can mutate again.

		populations

[-j	/* not used... */]

-K*	--KAPPA  [P <pop>] <kappa> 
		set transition transversion rate

-Tk  [P <pop>] <K> <r>
		used with -T to implement logistic growth rate
		
-L  --length  <nloci> <L1> [<L2>...<Ln>] [R]
		set sequence lengths and number of loci

-l	--linkage  <p/g> <d1> [<d2>...<dn-1>] [R]
		set linkage between adjacent loci

-M	--substMod  <mod> [args]
		set the substitution model

-m*	--mig_mat {see documentation...}
		set the migration rates to and from populations

-N*	--popSize  [P <pop>] <size>
		set the effective size of a population

-n*	--sampSize  [P <pop>] [R <tau_d>] [S <tau_1>]] <SS1> [<SS2>...<SSNpops>]
		set the number of individuals sampled from a population.  When used
		as -Tn, a time must be specified for sampling, and opens the ability for
		[R]ecurrent sampling starting at the pre-specified time, and repeat every
		tau_d*PN_A generations until the end of the simulation, or a specified
		[S]top time tau_1.  Note that the sample size must be specified at the
		end (either a single number to be applied to all populations or include
		a number for every population).  You can use -Tn multiple times.

[-O	/* not used...*/]

-o	--outfile  [a] <file>
		print output to specific file

-P	--ploidy  <P>
		set the ploidy, P=1 is haploid, P=2 is diploid, P=4 is tetraploid

-p	--tetraType  <0/1>
		set the type of tetraploid [allo- or auto-]

[-Q	/* not used... */]

-q*   --baseFreq [P <pop>] <pi_C> <pi_G> <pi_T> <pi_A>
		set the equilibrium base frequencies (default = 0.25)

-R	--ReportBurnFixed
		report mutations that fixed during burn-in

-r*	--rho  [P <pop>] [F <filename>] <rho>
		set the recombination rate for a population

-TS  <t> <i> <j>

		rate of insertion/deletions with Poisson length distribution

-u*	--indel  [P <pop>] <INSrate> <DELrate> <mean_length> 
		rate of insertion/deletions with geometric length distribution

-V	--rateClassSites  [P <pop>] <nclasses> <alpha> 
		mutation rate variation among SITES

-v	--rateClassLoci  [P <pop>] <nclasses> <alpha>
		mutation rate variation among LOCI

-W*  --selDistType  [P <pop>] [L <locus>] [F <allele_freq> [w] [T [R <min_freq> <max_freq> [S] [A [G <gens>]] [M <max_reps>]] [F [a] <file>]]] <type> [args]
		set distribution of selective effects.  See documentation for proper
		usage of <type> [args].  Set the distribution for a [P]opulation or
		[L]ocus.  In -TW mode, change selection coefficient of an existing
		polymorphism with a particular [F]requency.  If a frequency is specified,
		you can [T]rack the allele to ensure that it achieves a particular
		frequency [R]ange at time of sampling ([S]top the first time in range), 
		[A]utomatically restart if the allele is lost (up to a [M]aximal number of
		tries), and output the trajectory to a [F]ile (or [a]ppend to existing).
		Note that tracking a mutation here prevents you from tracking a locus using
		--trackTrajectory.  Unfortunately, tracking only occurs after selection
		coefficient changes.

-w*	--neutPop  <pop>
		allow a population to be neutral

[-X	/* not used... */]

-x	--sex  <x1> [<x2 >..<xR>] [R]
		indicate whether each locus is autosomal/sex

-Y*	--pMaleRec  [P <pop>] <p>
		proportion of recombinants occuring in male meioses vs female.

-y*	--pMaleMig  [P <pop>] <pmale>
		proportion of migrants that are male

-Z	--additive 
		specify an additive model of selective effects instead of multiplicative

-z*	--inversions  [P <pop>] <INVrate> <mean_length>
		rate of inversions with Poisson length distribution
PROGRAM:       convertSFS_CODE
DEVELOPER:     Ryan D. Hernandez
RELEASE DATE:  ???

DESCRIPTION:
	Convert simulated data output from sfs_code to a more useful
	form.  Examples are the overall site-frequency spectrum, or
	the input into another program such as structure, or the
	fasta sequence alignment.

USAGE:  ./convertSFS_CODE <input_file> [options]

OPTIONS:
	--help (-h)
		Print this help menu
	--alignment (-a) [A] [F <filename>] [P <#pops> <P1>..<P#pops>] 
		  [I <#indiv> <I1>..<I#indiv>] [P.I <#comb> <P1.I1>..<Pn.In>]
		  [L <#loci> <L1>..<L#loci>] [ITS <#its>]
		Print the alignment in fasta format.  Use "A" option to print
		ancestral sequences.  Use "F" option
		to print the output to the file <filename>.  Use "P" option
		to print only specific populations, or "I" option for
		specific individuals.  Use "P.I" option to print only
		spcific individuals from specific populations, and use "L"
		to print output from specific loci.  Use "T" option to
		print only first <#its> iterations.  Note: cannot use
		both "P" and "I" options (use "P.I" instead).  By
		default, a fasta style alignment of all individuals across
		all loci and iterations will be printed to the screen.

	--MK (-m) <ingroup> <outgroup> [OBS] [F [a] <file>]
		   [L <#loci> <L1>..<L#loc>] [ITS [#its]] [OGSS <OG_size>
		Extract McDonald-Kreitman (MK) tables for comparing <ingroup>
		to <outgroup>.  By default, will print the MK table for the
		true data (saved during simulation) summed over all loci &
		iterations, with each entry space delimited.  Using "OBS"
		option will print the observed MK table based on parsimony
		(by default a single sequence from the outgroup will be used
		for divergence, but specifying OG_size can change this).
		Use "F" to print output to the file <file> (include 'a'
		to append to file instead of over-writing it).  Use "L" to
		print specific loci (<#loci> = -1 prints seperate MK tables at
		each locus).  To print each iteration indepdently, use 
		'ITS' option (to print only a subset of iterations, 
		include the number of iterations [#its].  Using the "OGSS"
		option sets the outgroup size to <OG_size>, such that any
		mutation carried by the first <OG_size> chromosomes in the
		outgroup will be considered a fixed difference (setting
		<OG_size> = -1 is uses the entire sample size).
		Each MK table is printed in the following order:
		<PS> <PN> <FS> <FN>, where 'P' refers to polymorphic,
		'F' fixed, 'S' synonymous and 'N' is nonsynonymous.

	--SFS (-s) [OBS <P1> <P2> [OG_size]] [T <0/1/2>] [F [a] <file>]
		   [L <#loci> <L1>..<L#loc>] [P <#pops> <P1>..<P#pops>]
		   [ITS [#its]]
		Extract Site-Frequency Spectra.  By default, will print the
		SFS for the true data (saved during simulation) summed
		over all loci & iterations, each entry space delimited and
		populations separated by a tab.  Using "OBS" option will
		print the observed SFS for population <P1> using <P2> as an 
		outgroup to parsimoniously determine the ancestral state of
		each SNP (arbitrarily chooses first sequence from outgroup as
		reference unless OG_size is specified).  Use "T" option to
		change the type of SFS extracted:
		0=synonymous, 1=nonsynonymous, 2=all mutants (default).
		Use "F" to print output to the file <file> (include 'a'
		to append to file instead of over-writing it).  Use "L" to
		print specific loci (<#loci> = -1 prints seperate SFS for
		each locus).  Use "P" to print the SFS only from specific
		populations (only valid for true data, i.e. not when using
		OBS flag).  To print each iteration indepdently, use 'ITS'
		flag (to print only a subset of iterations, include the
		number of iterations [#its].
