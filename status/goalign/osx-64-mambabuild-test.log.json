goalign: A set of tools to handle sequence alignments.

It allows to :
1 - Convert formats
2 - Shuffle alignments
3 - Sample alignments
4 - Print informations about alignments
5 - Generate bootstrap alignments

Input alignment file formats:
1. Fasta (default)
2. Phylip (-p option)
3. Nexus (-x option)
4. Clustal (-u option)
4. Auto detect (--auto-detect option). In that case, it will test input formats in the following order:
    1. Fasta
    2. Nexus
    3. Phylip
    4. Clustal
    If none of these formats is recognized, then will exit with an error 

Please note that in --auto-detect mode, phylip format is considered as not strict!

Version: 0.3.4

Usage:
  goalign [flags]
  goalign [command]

Available Commands:
  addid       Adds a string to each sequence identifier of the input alignment
  append      Append alignments to an input alignment
  build       Command to build bootstrap replicates
  clean       Removes gap sites or sequences
  codonalign  Aligns a given nt fasta file using a corresponding aa alignment
  completion  Generates auto-completion commands for bash or zsh
  compress    Removes identical patterns/sites from an input alignment
  compute     Different computations (distances, entropy, etc.)
  concat      Concatenates a set of alignments
  consensus   Compute the majority consensus of an input alignment
  dedup       Deduplicate sequences that have the same sequence
  diff        Prints only characters that are different from the first sequence of the alignment
  divide      Divide an input alignment in several output files
  draw        Draw alignments
  extract     Extracts several sub-sequences from an input alignment
  help        Help about any command
  identical   Assess whether the two alignments are identical
  mask        Mask a sub alignment
  mutate      Adds substitutions (~sequencing errors), or gaps, uniformly in an input alignment
  orf         Find the longest orf in all given sequences in forward strand
  phase       Find best Starts and set them as new start positions
  phasent     Find best Starts and set them as new start positions
  random      Generate random sequences
  reformat    Reformats input alignment into phylip of fasta format
  rename      Rename sequences of the input alignment, given a map file
  replace     Replace characters in sequences of the input alignment (possible with a regex)
  revcomp     Prints the reverse complement of all sequences
  sample      Samples sequences or sites from an input alignment
  shuffle     A set of commands to shuffle an alignment
  sort        sorts input alignment by sequence name
  split       Splits an input alignment given a partition file
  stats       Prints different characteristics of the alignment
  subseq      Take a sub-alignment from the input alignment
  subset      Take a subset of sequences from the input alignment
  subsites    Takes a subset of the sites of the alignment
  sw          Aligns 2 sequences using Smith&Waterman algorithm
  translate   Translates an input alignment in amino acids
  transpose   Transpose an input alignment
  trim        This command trims names of sequences or sequences themselves
  unalign     Unaligns input alignment
  version     Prints the current version of goalign

Flags:
  -i, --align string           Alignment input file (default "stdin")
      --auto-detect            Auto detects input format (overrides -p, -x and -u)
  -u, --clustal                Alignment is in clustal? default fasta
  -h, --help                   help for goalign
      --ignore-identical int   Ignore duplicated sequences that have the same name and potentially have same sequences, 0 : Does not ignore anything, 1: Ignore sequences having the same name (keep the first one whatever their sequence), 2: Ignore sequences having the same name and the same sequence
      --input-strict           Strict phylip input format (only used with -p)
  -x, --nexus                  Alignment is in nexus? default fasta
      --no-block               Write Phylip sequences without space separated blocks (only used with -p)
      --one-line               Write Phylip sequences on 1 line (only used with -p)
      --output-strict          Strict phylip output format (only used with -p)
  -p, --phylip                 Alignment is in phylip? default fasta
      --seed int               Random Seed: -1 = nano seconds since 1970/01/01 00:00:00 (default -1)
  -t, --threads int            Number of threads (default 1)
