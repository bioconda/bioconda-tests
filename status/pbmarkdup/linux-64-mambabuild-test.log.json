pbmarkdup - Mark duplicate reads from PacBio sequencing of an amplified library.

Usage:
  pbmarkdup [options] <INFILE.bam|xml|fa|fq|fofn> <OUTFILE.bam|xml|fa.gz|fq.gz>

  INFILE.bam|xml|fa|fq|fofn    STR   Input file(s) as BAM, DATASET.XML, FASTA[.GZ], FASTQ[.GZ], or FOFN
  OUTFILE.bam|xml|fa.gz|fq.gz  STR   Output file as BAM, DATASET.XML, FASTA.GZ or FASTQ.GZ


Duplicate Marking Options:
  --cross-library,-x                 Identify duplicates across sequencing libraries (LB tag in read group).

Output Options:
  --rmdup,-r                         Exclude duplicates from OUTFILE. Redundant when --dup-file is provided.
  --dup-file                   STR   Write duplicates to this file instead of OUTFILE.
  --clobber,-f                       Overwrite OUTFILE if it exists.

  -h,--help                          Show this help and exit.
  --version                          Show application version and exit.
  -j,--num-threads             INT   Number of threads to use, 0 means autodetection. [0]
  --log-level                  STR   Set log level. Valid choices: (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, FATAL). [WARN]
  --log-file                   FILE  Log to a file, instead of stderr.
