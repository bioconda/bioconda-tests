              command ...

Condition a command for execution on a cluster.

positional arguments:
  command               command to run
  arg                   command arguments

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w, --in-workflow     Run the command as part of a workflow. After launching
                        all of the jobs, tardis waits for all outputs, which
                        are then collated and merged into a single output
                        file, as specified by the output file path in the
                        original command; all of the temporary input files
                        (for example chunks of uncompressed fastq) are deleted
                        provided all prior steps completed without error (if
                        there was an error they are left there to assist with
                        debugging). Without this option, the program exits
                        immediately after launching all of the jobs, and
                        output is left un-collated in the scratch folder
                        created by this script, and no cleanup is done.
  -c N, --chunksize N   When conditioning the input file(s), split into files
                        each containing N logical records. (A logical record
                        for a sequence file is a complete sequence. For a text
                        file it is a line of text). (If the -s option is used
                        to sample the inputs, the chunksize relates to the
                        full un-sampled file . so the same chunk-size can be
                        used whether random sampling or not. For example a
                        chunksize of 1,000,000 is specified in combination
                        with a sampling rate of .0001, then each chunk would
                        contain 100 sequences . i.e. you should not adjust the
                        chunk-size, for the sampling rate. Note that to avoid
                        a race-condition that could be caused by a very small
                        chunk-size resulting in launching a very large number
                        of jobs, tardis will throw an exception if the chunk-
                        size used would result in launching more than
                        MAX_DIMENSION jobs (currently 5000) )
  --from N, --from-record N
                        When conditioning the input file(s), only use records
                        from the input file after or including N (where that
                        is logical record number . e.g. in a fastq file, start
                        from record number N means start from sequence N). By
                        combining this option with -to, you can process slices
                        of a file. Note that this option has no affect when
                        processing a list-file.
  --to N, --to-record N
                        When conditioning the input file(s), only use records
                        up to and including the record N (where that is
                        logical record number . e.g. in a fastq file, process
                        up to record number N means process up to and
                        including sequence N). By combining this option with
                        -from, you can process slices of a file. Note that
                        this option has no affect when processing a list-file.
  -s RATE               Rather than process the entire input file(s), a random
                        sample of the records is processed. RATE is the
                        probability that a given record will be sampled. For
                        example -s .001 will result in roughly 1 in every 1000
                        logical records being sampled. When the -s option is
                        specified, tardis does not clean up the conditioned
                        input and output . e.g. all of the uncompressed fastq
                        sample fragments would be retained. These are retained
                        to assist with the Q/C work that is normally
                        associated with a sampled run. Paired fastq input
                        files are sampled in lock-step, provided the paired
                        fastq conditioning directive is used for both files.
  -d DIR, --rootdir DIR
                        create the tardis working folder under DIR. If no
                        working root is specified, a default location is used.
  --dry-run             validate the run by doing a dry run. This means that
                        the chunks, job scripts and job files etc. are all
                        generated but the jobs are not launched. The user can
                        start then kill (CTRL-C) the run, inspect the script
                        and job files that were generated to check that their
                        command has been conditioned as envisaged.
  -k, --keep-conditioned-data
                        keep the conditioned input and output - i.e. the input
                        and output fragments. Normally in workflow mode these
                        are deleted after the output is successfully
                        "unconditioned" - i.e. joined back together
  --job-file FILE       optionally supply a job template - tardis will read
                        the contents of FILE and use this as the job template.
  --templatedir DIR     template directory
  --job-template-name NAME
                        job template name, resolved in template directory
  --hpctype HPCTYPE     indicate the hpc environment. Currently the only
                        supported values are: condor which results in tardis
                        attempting to set up and launch condor jobs; local
                        which results in each job being launched by tardis
                        itself on the local machine, using the native python
                        sub-process API. The maximum number of processes it
                        will run at a time is controlled by a global variable
                        in the script MAX_PROCESSES, which is initially 10;
                        slurm which results in tardis attempting to set up and
                        launch slurm jobs.
  --batonfile FILE      if you supply a "baton file" FILE, tardis will write
                        the process exit code to this file after all
                        processing has completed. This can be useful to
                        preserve synchronous execution of a workflow, even if
                        tardis is started in the background - the workflow can
                        test the existence of the batonfile - if it exists
                        then the corresponding tardis processing step has
                        completed (i.e. another way of each step in a workflow
                        "passing the baton" to the next step)
  --shell-include-file FILE, --runtimeconfigsourcefile FILE
                        shell script fragment included in jobs
  -q, --quiet           run quietly
  --userconfig FILE     user configuration file
  --no-sysconfig        ignore the system configuration file
