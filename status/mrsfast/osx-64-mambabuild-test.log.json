[1mNAME[0m
       mrsfast-ultra

[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       mrsFAST is a cache oblivious read mapping tool. mrsFAST capable of map-
       ping single and paired end reads to  the  reference  genome.  Bisulfite
       treated  sequences are not supported in this version.


[1mINSTALLATION[0m
       To  install  mrsFAST-ultra, please download the source zip package from
       http://sourceforge.net/projects/mrsfast/.  After  unzipping  the  down-
       loaded  file "mrsfast-ultra-3.X.X.zip", change the current directory to
       the source directory "mrsfast-ultra-3.X.X", and run "make" in the  ter-
       minal.  The  binary  file  "mrsfast" will be created, which is ready to
       use.
       $ unzip mrsfast-ultra-3.X.X.zip
       $ cd mrsfast-ultra-3.X.X
       $ make

              Map the reads in SNP aware mode. In this mode mrsFAST-Ultra tol-
              erates the mismatches in known SNP  locations  reported  by  the
              provided SNP database. The SNP index [4msnp-file[0m
               should  be created from the dbSNP (.vcf) file using the snp_in-

       [1m--snp-qual [4m[22mquality-threshold[0m
              In SNP-aware mode, a mismatch at a reported SNP location will be
              ignored  only  if  the corresponding read location has a quality
              higher than or equal to the [4mquality-threshold[24m  [4mquality-threshold[0m
              is  a  Phred-Value  base  33. The default is 53 (base call error
              0.01).
