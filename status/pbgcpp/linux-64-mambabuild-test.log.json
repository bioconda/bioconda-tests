gcpp - Compute genomic consensus from alignments and call variants relative to the reference.

Usage:
  gcpp [options] <input.bam>

  input.bam                    STR    The input BAM file.

Required input/output files:
  -r,--reference               FILE   The filename of the reference FASTA file.
  -o,--output                  STR    The output filename(s), as a comma-separated list. Valid output formats are
                                      .fa/.fasta, .fq/.fastq, .gff, .vcf

Output filtering:
  -q,--min-confidence          INT    The minimum confidence for a variant call to be output to variants.{gff,vcf} [40]
  -x,--min-coverage            INT    The minimum site coverage that must be achieved for variant calls and consensus
                                      to be calculated for a site. [5]
  --no-evidence-call           STR    The consensus base that will be output for sites with no effective coverage.
                                      Valid choices: (nocall, reference, lowercasereference). [lowercasereference]

Read selection/filtering:
  -X,--coverage                INT    A designation of the maximum coverage level to be used for analysis. Exact
                                      interpretation is algorithm-specific. The meaningful range of this argument is
                                      [1, 250]. [100]
  --min-accuracy               FLOAT  The minimum acceptable window-global alignment accuracy for reads that will be
                                      used for the analysis (arrow-only). [0.82]
  -m,--min-map-qv              INT    The minimum MapQV for reads that will be used for analysis. [10]
  --min-read-score             FLOAT  The minimum ReadScore for reads that will be used for analysis (arrow-only).
                                      [0.65]
  --min-snr                    FLOAT  The minimum acceptable signal-to-noise over all channels for reads that will be
                                      used for analysis (arrow-only). [2.5]
  -w,--windows                 STR    The window (or multiple comma-delimited windows) of the reference to be
                                      processed, in the format refGroup:refStart-refEnd (default: entire reference).

Algorithm and parameter settings:
  --algorithm                  STR    The consensus algorithm used. Valid choices: (arrow, plurality, poa). [arrow]
  --mask-radius                INT    Radius of window to use when excluding local regions for exceeding
                                      maskMinErrorRate, where 0 disables any filtering (arrow-only). [3]
  --mask-error-rate            FLOAT  Maximum local error rate before the local region defined bymaskRadius is excluded
                                      from polishing (arrow-only). [0.7]
  -P,--parameters-file         STR    Path to a model file or directory containing model files.
  -p,--parameters-spec         STR    Name of chemistry or model to use, overriding default selection.
  --max-iterations             INT    Maximum number of iterations to polish the template. [40]
  --max-poa-coverage           INT    Maximum number of sequences to use for consensus calling. [11]
  --mutation-separation        INT    Find the best mutations within a separation window for iterative polishing. [10]
  --mutation-neighborhood      INT    Find nearby mutations within neighborhood for iterative polishing. [20]
  --read-stumpiness-threshold  FLOAT  Filter out reads whose aligned length along a subread is lower than a percentage
                                      of its corresponding reference length. [0.1]

Advanced configuration options:
  -C,--reference-chunk-size    INT    Size of reference chunks. [500]
  --reference-chunk-overlap    INT    Size of reference chunk overlaps. [5]
  --simple-chunking                   Disable adaptive reference chunking.
  --sort-strategy              STR    Read sorting strategy. Valid choices: (longest_and_strand_balanced, longest,
                                      spanning, file_order). [longest_and_strand_balanced]
  --min-poa-coverage           INT    Minimum number of reads required within a window to call consensus and variants
                                      using arrow or poa. [3]

  -h,--help                           Show this help and exit.
  --version                           Show application version and exit.
  -j,--num-threads             INT    Number of threads to use, 0 means autodetection. [0]
  --log-level                  STR    Set log level. Valid choices: (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, FATAL). [WARN]
  --log-file                   FILE   Log to a file, instead of stderr.
