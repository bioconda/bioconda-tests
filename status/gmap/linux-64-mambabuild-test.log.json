Usage: gmap [OPTIONS...] <FASTA files...>, or
       cat <FASTA files...> | gmap [OPTIONS...]

Input options (must include -d or -g)
  -D, --dir=directory            Genome directory.  Default (as specified by --with-gmapdb to the configure program) is
                                    $PREFIX/share
  -d, --db=STRING                Genome database.  If argument is '?' (with
                                   the quotes), this command lists available databases.

  -k, --kmer=INT                 kmer size to use in genome database (allowed values: 16 or less).
                                   If not specified, the program will find the highest available
                                   kmer size in the genome database
  --sampling=INT                 Sampling to use in genome database.  If not specified, the program
                                   will find the smallest available sampling value in the genome database
                                   within selected k-mer size
  -g, --gseg=filename            User-supplied genomic segment
  -1, --selfalign                Align one sequence against itself in FASTA format via stdin
                                   (Useful for getting protein translation of a nucleotide sequence)
  -2, --pairalign                Align two sequences in FASTA format via stdin, first one being
                                   genomic and second one being cDNA
  --cmdline=STRING,STRING        Align these two sequences provided on the command line,
                                   first one being genomic and second one being cDNA
  -q, --part=INT/INT             Process only the i-th out of every n sequences
                                   e.g., 0/100 or 99/100 (useful for distributing jobs
                                   to a computer farm).
  --input-buffer-size=INT        Size of input buffer (program reads this many sequences
                                   at a time for efficiency) (default 1000)

Computation options
  -B, --batch=INT                Batch mode (default = 2)
                                 Mode     Positions       Genome
                                   0      mmap            mmap
                                   1      mmap & preload  mmap
                      (default)    2      mmap & preload  mmap & preload
                                   3      allocate        mmap & preload
                                   4      allocate        allocate
                                   5      allocate        allocate     (same as 4)
                           Note: For a single sequence, all data structures use mmap
                           If mmap not available and allocate not chosen, then will use fileio (very slow)
  --use-shared-memory=INT        If 1, then allocated memory is shared among all processes on this node
                                   If 0 (default), then each process has private allocated memory
  --nosplicing                   Turns off splicing (useful for aligning genomic sequences
                                   onto a genome)
  --max-deletionlength=INT       Max length for a deletion (default 100).  Above this size,
                                   a genomic gap will be considered an intron rather than a deletion.
                                   If the genomic gap is less than --max-deletionlength and greater
                                   than --min-intronlength, a known splice site or splice site probabilities
                                   of 0.80 on both sides will be reported as an intron.
  --min-intronlength=INT         Min length for one internal intron (default 9).  Below this size,
                                   a genomic gap will be considered a deletion rather than an intron.
                                   If the genomic gap is less than --max-deletionlength and greater
                                   than --min-intronlength, a known splice site or splice site probabilities
                                   of 0.80 on both sides will be reported as an intron.
  --max-intronlength-middle=INT  Max length for one internal intron (default 500000).  Note: for backward
                                   compatibility, the -K or --intronlength flag will set both
                                   --max-intronlength-middle and --max-intronlength-ends.
                                   Also see --split-large-introns below.
  --max-intronlength-ends=INT    Max length for first or last intron (default 10000).  Note: for backward
                                   compatibility, the -K or --intronlength flag will set both
                                   --max-intronlength-middle and --max-intronlength-ends.
  --split-large-introns          Sometimes GMAP will exceed the value for --max-intronlength-middle,
                                   if it finds a good single alignment.  However, you can force GMAP
                                   to split such alignments by using this flag
  --trim-end-exons=INT           Trim end exons with fewer than given number of matches
                                   (in nt, default 12)
  -w, --localsplicedist=INT      Max length for known splice sites at ends of sequence
                                   (default 2000000)
  -L, --totallength=INT          Max total intron length (default 2400000)
  -x, --chimera-margin=INT       Amount of unaligned sequence that triggers
                                   search for the remaining sequence (default 30).
                                   Enables alignment of chimeric reads, and may help
                                   with some non-chimeric reads.  To turn off, set to
                                   zero.
  --no-chimeras                  Turns off finding of chimeras.  Same effect as --chimera-margin=0

                                   sense_filter, antisense_filter,or auto (default))
  --canonical-mode=INT           Reward for canonical and semi-canonical introns
                                   0=low reward, 1=high reward (default), 2=low reward for
                                   high-identity sequences and high reward otherwise
  --cross-species                Use a more sensitive search for canonical splicing, which helps especially
                                   for cross-species alignments and other difficult cases
  --allow-close-indels=INT       Allow an insertion and deletion close to each other
                                   (0=no, 1=yes (default), 2=only for high-quality alignments)
  --microexon-spliceprob=FLOAT   Allow microexons only if one of the splice site probabilities is
                                   greater than this value (default 0.95)
  --indel-open                   In dynamic programming, opening penalty for indel
  --indel-extend                 In dynamic programming, extension penalty for indel
                                   Values for --indel-open and --indel-extend should be in [-127,-1].
                                   If value is < -127, then will use -127 instead.
                                   If --indel-open and --indel-extend are not specified, values are chosen
                                   adaptively, based on the differences between the query and reference
  --cmetdir=STRING               Directory for methylcytosine index files (created using cmetindex)
                                   (default is location of genome index files specified using -D, -V, and -d)
  --atoidir=STRING               Directory for A-to-I RNA editing index files (created using atoiindex)
                                   (default is location of genome index files specified using -D, -V, and -d)
  --mode=STRING                  Alignment mode: standard (default), cmet-stranded, cmet-nonstranded,
                                    atoi-stranded, atoi-nonstranded, ttoc-stranded, or ttoc-nonstranded.
                                    Non-standard modes requires you to have previously run the cmetindex
                                    or atoiindex programs (which also cover the ttoc modes) on the genome
  -p, --prunelevel               Pruning level: 0=no pruning (default), 1=poor seqs,
                                   2=repetitive seqs, 3=poor and repetitive

Output options
  -n, --npaths=INT               Maximum number of paths to show (default 5).  If set to 1, GMAP
                                   will not report chimeric alignments, since those imply
                                   two paths.  If you want a single alignment plus chimeric
                                   alignments, then set this to be 0.
  --suboptimal-score=FLOAT       Report only paths whose score is within this value of the
                                   best path.
                                 If specified between 0.0 and 1.0, then treated as a fraction
                                   of the score of the best alignment (matches minus penalties for
                                   mismatches and indels).  Otherwise, treated as an integer
                                   number to be subtracted from the score of the best alignment.
                                   Default value is 0.50.
  -O, --ordered                  Print output in same order as input (relevant
                                   only if there is more than one worker thread)
  -5, --md5                      Print MD5 checksum for each query sequence
  -o, --chimera-overlap          Overlap to show, if any, at chimera breakpoint
  --failsonly                    Print only failed alignments, those with no results
  --nofails                      Exclude printing of failed alignments

  -V, --snpsdir=STRING           Directory for SNPs index files (created using snpindex) (default is
                                   location of genome index files specified using -D and -d)
   -v, --use-snps=STRING          Use database containing known SNPs (in <STRING>.iit, built
                                   previously using snpindex) for tolerance to SNPs
  --split-output=STRING          Basename for multiple-file output, separately for nomapping,
                                   uniq, mult, (and chimera, if --chimera-margin is selected)
  --failed-input=STRING          Print completely failed alignments as input FASTA or FASTQ format
                                   to the given file.  If the --split-output flag is also given, this file
                                   is generated in addition to the output in the .nomapping file.
  --append-output                When --split-output or --failedinput is given, this flag will append output
                                   to the existing files.  Otherwise, the default is to create new files.
  --output-buffer-size=INT       Buffer size, in queries, for output thread (default 1000).  When the number
                                   of results to be printed exceeds this size, worker threads wait
                                   until the backlog is cleared

                                   is unclear, and replaces this value arbitrarily with XS:A:+.
                                   May be useful for some programs, such as Cufflinks, that cannot
                                   handle XS:A:?.  However, if you use this flag, the reported value
                                   of XS:A:+ in these cases will not be meaningful.

                                   Note that the noprint option does not print the CIGAR string at all if there
                                   is an error, so it may break a SAM parser

  -j, --quality-print-shift=INT  Shift FASTQ quality scores by this amount in output
                                   (default is 0 for sanger protocol; to change Illumina input

  --force-single-end             When multiple FASTQ files are provided on the command line, GSNAP assumes
                                    they are matching paired-end files.  This flag treats each file as single-end.
  --filter-chastity=STRING       Skips reads marked by the Illumina chastity program.  Expecting a string
                                   after the accession having a 'Y' after the first colon, like this:
                                         @accession 1:Y:0:CTTGTA
                                   where the 'Y' signifies filtering by chastity.
                                   Values: off (default), either, both.  For 'either', a 'Y' on either end
                                   of a paired-end read will be filtered.  For 'both', a 'Y' is required
                                   on both ends of a paired-end read (or on the only end of a single-end read).

                      (default)    4      allocate      allocate        allocate        allocate            allocate
                           Note: For a single sequence, all data structures use mmap
                           A batch level of 5 means the same as 4, and is kept only for backward compatibility
  --use-shared-memory=INT        If 1, then allocated memory is shared among all processes on this node
                                   If 0 (default), then each process has private allocated memory
  --preload-shared-memory        Load files indicated by --batch mode into shared memory for use by other
                                   GMAP/GSNAP processes on this node, and then exit.  Ignore any input files.
  --unload-shared-memory         Unload files indicated by --batch mode into shared memory, or allow them
                                   to be unloaded when existing GMAP/GSNAP processes on this node are finished
                                   with them.  Ignore any input files.
  -m, --max-mismatches=FLOAT     Maximum number of mismatches allowed (if not specified, then
                                   GSNAP tries to find the best possible match in the genome)
                                   If specified between 0.0 and 1.0, then treated as a fraction
                                   of each read length.  Otherwise, treated as an integral number
                                   of mismatches (including indel and splicing penalties).
                                   Default is to be unspecified (to find the best possible match)
  --max-ref-mismatches=FLOAT     If GSNAP is run under SNP-tolerant or masked genome mode, then the
                                   --max-mismatches parameter above is for mismatches against reference and
                                   SNPs, or against the unmasked genome, respectively.  The --max-ref-mismatches
                                   parameter is against mismatches against the reference genome or masked genome.
  --min-coverage=FLOAT           Minimum coverage required for an alignment.
                                   If specified between 0.0 and 1.0, then treated as a fraction
                                   of each read length.  Otherwise, treated as an integral number
                                   of base pairs.  Default value is 0.5.

                                   --max-mismatches and --max-ref-mismatches parameters.
                                   Default for RNA-Seq is 1 (yes) so we can allow for
                                   reads that align past the ends of an exon.  Default for DNA-Seq
                                   is 0 (no).
                                 For RNA-Seq, trimmed ends should be ignored, because trimming
                                   is performed at probable splice sites, to allow for reads that
                                   align past the ends of an exon.
  --query-unk-mismatch=INT       Whether to count unknown (N) characters in the query as a mismatch
                                   (0=no (default), 1=yes)
  --genome-unk-mismatch=INT      Whether to count unknown (N) characters in the genome as a mismatch
                                   (0=no, 1=yes).  If --use-mask is specified, default is no, otherwise yes.
  -i, --indel-penalty=INT        Penalty for an indel (default 2).
                                   Counts against mismatches allowed.  To find indels, make
                                   indel-penalty less than or equal to max-mismatches.
                                   A value < 2 can lead to false positives at read ends
  --indel-endlength=INT          Minimum length at end required for indel alignments (default 4)
  -y, --max-middle-insertions=FLOAT  Maximum number of middle insertions allowed (default is 0.2)
                                     If specified between 0.0 and 1.0, then treated as a fraction
                                     of each read length.  Otherwise, treated as an integral number
                                     of base pairs
  -z, --max-middle-deletions=FLOAT   Maximum number of middle deletions allowed (default 0.2)
                                     If specified between 0.0 and 1.0, then treated as a fraction
                                     of each read length.  Otherwise, treated as an integral number
                                     of base pairs
  -Y, --max-end-insertions=INT   Maximum number of end insertions allowed (default 3)
  -Z, --max-end-deletions=INT    Maximum number of end deletions allowed (default 3)
  -M, --suboptimal-levels=INT    Report suboptimal hits beyond best hit (default 0)
                                   All hits with best score plus suboptimal-levels are reported
  -a, --adapter-strip=STRING     Method for removing adapters from reads.  Currently allowed values: off, paired.
                                   Default is "off".  To turn on, specify "paired", which removes adapters
                                   from paired-end reads if they appear to be present.
  --trim-indel-score=INT         Score to use for indels when trimming at ends.  To turn off trimming,
                                   specify 0.  Default is -2 for both RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq.  Warning:
                                   Turning trimming off in RNA-Seq can give false positive indels
                                   at the ends of reads
  -e, --use-mask=STRING          Use genome containing masks (e.g. for non-exons) for scoring preference
  -V, --snpsdir=STRING           Directory for SNPs index files (created using snpindex) (default is
                                   location of genome index files specified using -D and -d)
   -v, --use-snps=STRING          Use database containing known SNPs (in <STRING>.iit, built
                                   previously using snpindex) for tolerance to SNPs
  --cmetdir=STRING               Directory for methylcytosine index files (created using cmetindex)
                                   (default is location of genome index files specified using -D, -V, and -d)
  --atoidir=STRING               Directory for A-to-I RNA editing index files (created using atoiindex)
                                   (default is location of genome index files specified using -D, -V, and -d)
  --mode=STRING                  Alignment mode: standard (default), cmet-stranded, cmet-nonstranded,
                                    atoi-stranded, atoi-nonstranded, ttoc-stranded, or ttoc-nonstranded.
                                    Non-standard modes requires you to have previously run the cmetindex
                                    or atoiindex programs (which also cover the ttoc modes) on the genome
  -t, --nthreads=INT             Number of worker threads
  --max-anchors=INT              Controls number of candidate segments returned by the complete set algorithm
                                   Default is 10.  Can be increased to higher values to solve alignments with
                                   evenly spaced mismatches at close distances.  However, higher values will
                                   cause GSNAP to run more slowly.  A value of 1000, for example, slows down
                                   the program by a factor of 10 or so.  Therefore, change this value only if
                                   absolutely necessary.
Splicing options for DNA-Seq
  --find-dna-chimeras=INT              Look for distant splicing involving poor splice sites (0=no, 1=yes)
                                         If not specified, then default is to be on unless only known splicing
                                         is desired (--use-splicing is specified and --novelsplicing is off)

Splicing options for RNA-Seq
  -N, --novelsplicing=INT              Look for novel splicing (0=no (default), 1=yes)
  --splicingdir=STRING                 Directory for splicing involving known sites or known introns,
                                         as specified by the -s or --use-splicing flag (default is
                                         directory computed from -D and -d flags).  Note: can
                                         just give full pathname to the -s flag instead.
  -s, --use-splicing=STRING            Look for splicing involving known sites or known introns
                                         (in <STRING>.iit), at short or long distances
                                         See README instructions for the distinction between known sites
                                         and known introns
  --ambig-splice-noclip                For ambiguous known splicing at ends of the read, do not clip at the
                                         splice site, but extend instead into the intron.  This flag makes
                                         sense only if you provide the --use-splicing flag, and you are trying
                                         to eliminate all soft clipping with --trim-mismatch-score=0
  -w, --localsplicedist=INT            Definition of local novel splicing event (default 200000)
  --novelend-splicedist=INT            Distance to look for novel splices at the ends of reads (default 80000)
  --local-splice-penalty=INT       Penalty for a local splice (default 0).  Counts against mismatches allowed
  --fusion-sensitivity=INT         Sensitivity for finding fusions
  --distant-splice-penalty=INT     Penalty for a distant splice (default 1).  A distant splice is one where
                                         the intron length exceeds the value of -w, or --localsplicedist, or is an
                                         inversion, scramble, or translocation between two different chromosomes
                                         Counts against mismatches allowed
  --distant-splice-endlength=INT   Minimum length at end required for distant spliced alignments (default 20, min
                                         allowed is the value of -k, or kmer size)
  --shortend-splice-endlength=INT  Minimum length at end required for short-end spliced alignments (default 2,
                                         but unless known splice sites are provided with the -s flag, GSNAP may still
                                         need the end length to be the value of -k, or kmer size to find a given splice
  --distant-splice-identity=FLOAT      Minimum identity at end required for distant spliced alignments (default 0.95)
  --antistranded-penalty=INT           (Not currently implemented, since it leads to poor results)
                                         Penalty for antistranded splicing when using stranded RNA-Seq protocols.
                                         A positive value, such as 1, expects antisense on the first read
                                         and sense on the second read.  Default is 0, which treats sense and antisense
                                         equally well
  --merge-distant-samechr              Report distant splices on the same chromosome as a single splice, if possible.
                                         Will produce a single SAM line instead of two SAM lines, which is also done
                                         for translocations, inversions, and scramble events

Options for paired-end reads
  --pairmax-dna=INT              Max total genomic length for DNA-Seq paired reads, or other reads
                                   without splicing (default 2000).  Used if -N or -s is not specified.
                                   This value is also used for circular chromosomes when splicing in
                                   linear chromosomes is allowed
  --pairmax-rna=INT              Max total genomic length for RNA-Seq paired reads, or other reads
                                   that could have a splice (default 200000).  Used if -N or -s is specified.
                                   Should probably match the value for -w, --localsplicedist.
  --pairexpect=INT               Expected paired-end length, used for calling splices in medial part
                                   of paired-end reads (default 500).  Was turned off in previous versions, but reinstated.
  --pairdev=INT                  Allowable deviation from expected paired-end length, used for
                                   calling splices in medial part of paired-end reads (default 100).
                                   Was turned off in previous versions, but reinstated.

Options for quality scores
  --quality-protocol=STRING      Protocol for input quality scores.  Allowed values:
                                   illumina (ASCII 64-126) (equivalent to -J 64 -j -31)
                                   sanger   (ASCII 33-126) (equivalent to -J 33 -j 0)
                                 Default is sanger (no quality print shift)
                                 SAM output files should have quality scores in sanger protocol

                                 Or you can customize this behavior with these flags:
  -J, --quality-zero-score=INT   FASTQ quality scores are zero at this ASCII value
                                   (default is 33 for sanger protocol; for Illumina, select 64)
  -j, --quality-print-shift=INT  Shift FASTQ quality scores by this amount in output
                                   (default is 0 for sanger protocol; to change Illumina input
                                   to Sanger output, select -31)
Output options
  -n, --npaths=INT               Maximum number of paths to print (default 100).
  -Q, --quiet-if-excessive       If more than maximum number of paths are found,
                                   then nothing is printed.
  -O, --ordered                  Print output in same order as input (relevant
                                   only if there is more than one worker thread)
  --show-refdiff                 For GSNAP output in SNP-tolerant alignment, shows all differences
                                   relative to the reference genome as lower case (otherwise, it shows
                                   all differences relative to both the reference and alternate genome)
  --clip-overlap                 For paired-end reads whose alignments overlap, clip the overlapping region.
  --merge-overlap                For paired-end reads whose alignments overlap, merge the two ends into a single end (beta implementation)
  --print-snps                   Print detailed information about SNPs in reads (works only if -v also selected)
                                   (not fully implemented yet)
  --failsonly                    Print only failed alignments, those with no results
  --nofails                      Exclude printing of failed alignments
  --only-concordant              Print only concordant alignments (concordant_uniq, concordant_mult, concordant_circular)
  --omit-concordant-uniq         Do not print any concordant_uniq alignments
  --omit-concordant-mult         Do not print any concordant_mult alignments
  --omit-softclipped             Do not allow any alignments with soft clips
  -A, --format=STRING            Another format type, other than default.
                                   Currently implemented: sam, m8 (BLAST tabular format)
  --split-output=STRING          Basename for multiple-file output, separately for nomapping,
                                   halfmapping_uniq, halfmapping_mult, unpaired_uniq, unpaired_mult,
                                   paired_uniq, paired_mult, concordant_uniq, and concordant_mult results
  -o, --output-file=STRING       File name for a single stream of output results.
  --failed-input=STRING          Print completely failed alignments as input FASTA or FASTQ format,
                                    to the given file, appending .1 or .2, for paired-end data.
                                    If the --split-output flag is also given, this file is generated
                                    in addition to the output in the .nomapping file.
  --append-output                When --split-output or --failed-input is given, this flag will append output
                                    to the existing files.  Otherwise, the default is to create new files.
  --order-among-best=STRING      Among alignments tied with the best score, order those alignments in this order.
                                    Allowed values: genomic, random (default)
  --output-buffer-size=INT       Buffer size, in queries, for output thread (default 1000).  When the number
                                   of results to be printed exceeds this size, worker threads wait
                                   until the backlog is cleared

Options for SAM output
  --no-sam-headers               Do not print headers beginning with '@'
  --add-paired-nomappers         Add nomapper lines as needed to make all paired-end results alternate
                                   between first end and second end
  --paired-flag-means-concordant=INT  Whether the paired bit in the SAM flags means concordant only (1)
                                 or paired plus concordant (0, default)
  --sam-headers-batch=INT        Print headers only for this batch, as specified by -q
  --sam-hardclip-use-S           Use S instead of H for hardclips
  --sam-use-0M                   Insert 0M in CIGAR between adjacent insertions, deletions, and introns
                                   Picard disallows 0M, other tools may require it
  --sam-extended-cigar           Use extended CIGAR format (using X and = symbols instead of M,
                                   to indicate matches and mismatches, respectively
  --sam-multiple-primaries       Allows multiple alignments to be marked as primary if they
                                   have equally good mapping scores
  --sam-sparse-secondaries       For secondary alignments (in multiple mappings), uses '*' for SEQ
                                   and QUAL fields, to give smaller file sizes.  However, the output
                                   will give warnings in Picard to give warnings and may not work
                                   with downstream tools
  --force-xs-dir                 For RNA-Seq alignments, disallows XS:A:? when the sense direction
                                   is unclear, and replaces this value arbitrarily with XS:A:+.
                                   May be useful for some programs, such as Cufflinks, that cannot
                                   handle XS:A:?.  However, if you use this flag, the reported value
                                   of XS:A:+ in these cases will not be meaningful.
  --md-lowercase-snp             In MD string, when known SNPs are given by the -v flag,
                                   prints difference nucleotides as lower-case when they,
                                   differ from reference but match a known alternate allele
  --extend-soft-clips            Extends alignments through soft clipped regions.  CIGAR string and coordinates
                                   will be revised, but currently the MD string will reflect the clipped CIGAR
  --action-if-cigar-error        Action to take if there is a disagreement between CIGAR length and sequence length
                                   Allowed values: ignore, warning (default), noprint, abort
                                   Note that the noprint option does not print the CIGAR string at all if there
                                   is an error, so it may break a SAM parser
  --read-group-id=STRING         Value to put into read-group id (RG-ID) field
  --read-group-name=STRING       Value to put into read-group name (RG-SM) field
  --read-group-library=STRING    Value to put into read-group library (RG-LB) field
  --read-group-platform=STRING   Value to put into read-group library (RG-PL) field
