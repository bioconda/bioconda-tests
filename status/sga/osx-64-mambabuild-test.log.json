Contact: Jared Simpson [js18@sanger.ac.uk]
Usage: sga <command> [options]

Commands:
           preprocess               filter and quality-trim reads
           index                    build the BWT and FM-index for a set of reads
           merge                    merge multiple BWT/FM-index files into a single index
           bwt2fa                   transform a bwt back into a set of sequences
           correct                  correct sequencing errors in a set of reads
           fm-merge                 merge unambiguously overlapped sequences using the FM-index
           overlap                  compute overlaps between reads
           assemble                 generate contigs from an assembly graph
           oview                    view overlap alignments
           subgraph                 extract a subgraph from a graph
           filter                   remove reads from a data set
           rmdup                    duplicate read removal
           gen-ssa                  generate a sampled suffix array for the given set of reads
           scaffold                 generate ordered sets of contigs using distance estimates
           scaffold2fasta           convert the output of the scaffold subprogram into a fasta file
           gapfill                  fill intra-scaffold gaps


Variant Calling Commands:
           graph-diff               compare reads to find sequence variants
           graph-concordance        check called variants for representation in the assembly graph
           rewrite-evidence-bam     fill in sequence and quality information for a variant evidence BAM
           haplotype-filter         filter out low-quality haplotypes
           somatic-variant-filters  filter out low-quality variants


Experimental commands:
           preqc                 perform pre-assembly quality checks on a set of reads
           stats                 print summary statistics about a read set
           filterBAM             filter out contaminating mate-pair data in a BAM file
           cluster               find clusters of reads belonging to the same connected component in an assembly graph
